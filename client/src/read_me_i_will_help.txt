what we need for more GUI Optimization 

0 - Loop Functions -> need to be in vuex 
1 - All Server Functions  goes to the mutations with dynamic routes 
2 - error and warning and advanced options area ( Message area )
3 - Blochsphere update  
4 - Swap hovering
5 - S Dagar , T dagar gates images
6 - update max wire
7 - test 
8 - qasm image
9 - Merge Qasm by  Circuit Drawing
10- add wire not affect the jsonobject

validation of loops 
number must be in range of colsCount 
no inerchange between columns of loops

functions that need to be called when an event happens

function that validate controls 

function that collect all validate functions (swap and controls and so on )

get the matrix by a file

save to local storage  (custom gates , saved algorithms )

circiut drawing compnenet should be terminated and merged to Qasm
circuit loops and loop are a complete mess should be enhanced
tracing buttons all should be terminated and merged
in toolbox2 and functions be an action
revise custom mx

functions need to be in actions                |  thier  place 
----------------------------------------------------------
add , remove wire          (specific indices)  |  wire and trash
create matrix axios        (call the server)   |  add custom gate
nthRoot  get               (call the server)   |  add custom gate
cloneSubCircuitCustoGate   (call the server)   |  add custom gate
create boolean function    (call the server)   |  boolean function
sendQasm                   (call the server)   |  Qasm



2 features if applied will boost the performance 
-> make the gate is a component 
-> make list of every wire list of names not list of objects {name:'gateName'}
